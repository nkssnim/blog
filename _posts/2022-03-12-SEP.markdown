From January to March 2022, I had the opportunity to study at UC Davis as an exchange student.

Some background information about me:
At the time of student exchange, I was a 3rd year Electrical Engineering student at the National University of Singapore.
I would generally consider myself to be academically competent with 4.67/5.00 CAP (which translates to ~3.7 GPA in US universities).
The only experience I had with university education before student exchange was entirely online, with exclusively open-book tests.

With that out of the way, let's talk about what my schedule looked like at UC Davis:

## Schedule and Courses

I was taking 24 units (6 courses) in the Winter Quarter, with the average workload being 12-16 units, i.e., I was taking double the average workload.

Here are the courses I was taking:
- EEC 170: Intro to Computer Architecture
- EEC 145: Electronic Materials
- EEC 150: Intro to Signals & Systems
- EEC 130: Electromagnetics I
- MAT 021D: Vector Analysis
- MGT 150: Technology Management

and here's the schedule I was given:
![My UCD Schedule](/blog/myucdschedule.JPG)

Note that I never attended half of the classes on here (more on that later).

## Online Instruction (!)

During the first 4 weeks of instruction, classes were held entirely online due to the Omicron scare. Consequently, my experience with the classes before and after the transition to face-to-face instruction largely differs, and I will be covering this for each course I talk about later on.

## Expectations

This blog post wouldn't make any sense If I didn't state my expectations before we got into the nitty-gritty of the circus performance I was compelled to be a part of for 3 months.

1. Learn something useful from each class (which is a given)
2. Barely passing all of my classes since I was essentially tackling double the average workload
3. Looking forward to meeting cool people in class
4. No online exam BS (rip)

In case it wasn't obvious, none of my expectations were met, which isn't entirely a bad thing. You could even say I exceeded one of them. Anyhow, let's go through each course in detail.

## Course Reviews

### EEC 170: Intro to Computer Architecture

This course was taught by Professor John Owens. The main focus was the first 5 chapters of Patterson & Hennessy and assembly programming in RISC-V.

Out of all the courses I took, this one had the best delivery, the best projects and the best exams (in terms of quality of exam problems). Dr Owens is an exceedingly capable instructor and it's disappointing that this might be the only class I'll ever be able to take under his instruction. I believe he also teaches a course on parallel computing, which I would have loved to take if I had the chance to stay another quarter.

#### Office Hours & Consultation

There was a Slack channel for this course which the professor encouraged everyone to join. Slack was very active with a handful of people asking a lot of questions and the professor and TAs would always answer them within a day. Other good students (including me) would also chime in with answers whenever it was convenient. The Slack channel for this class was a massive game-changer because it was an avenue for everyone to see common questions answered without eating into lecture time.

There were 3 different office hour slots for the professor and the two TAs. I never attended any of them and solely relied on the Slack channel.

#### Lectures

Lecture slides were always available before class, with condensed (important) material from the textbook included. Lecture slides often required some annotations to make it digestible as reference material. Paying attention to lectures was important as Dr Owens had the remarkable ability to condense paragraphs worth of content from the textbook into short sentences that were easy to understand.

During online instruction, the lectures were held on Zoom and recorded. Dr Owens would use a green screen projecting his body superimposed against a colourful background with lecture slides appearing in the corner of the screen. Lecture was conducted in an interactive manner with the professor stopping every couple of minutes to ask everyone a question, and wouldn't move on until someone answered (someone would always answer). This style of lecture persisted even after the transition to face-to-face instruction. Face-to-face lectures were also recorded but only with audio and a static slideshow (no video of the entire lecture room like at NUS). He did a good job with the lecture delivery both online and offline, that's all I have to say.

#### Assignments & Projects

Homework was a mix of a set of problems made up by Dr Owens himself and from the textbook. The textbook problems would always have errors in them but any errata would quickly be pointed out in the Slack channel. Homework problems were invaluable for understanding of the concepts taught.

There were 3 projects centered around working with RISC-V to solve different problems. The first project was a simple set of programs that had to be written in RISC-V to meet some requirement. The second project was the RISC-V version of the [CMU Bomb Lab](http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/2e/README-bomblab) which involved reverse engineering assembly code to figure out the right input to defuse a 'bomb'. There were a lot of recursive patterns that tripped up most people but I managed to figure it out with the help of a really cool guy (hi Htet!). The third and final project involved writing a GEMM (general matrix multiplication) routine using non-blocked and blocked implementations in RISC-V, and then simulating a cache in a language like C to take the instruction stream from both routines and compare the performance between no cache, direct-mapped cache and two-way set associative cache implementations. I wrote my cache implementations in Python because I was lazy.

I scored full credit for all the projects; They weren't particularly difficult but they required you to understand the content really well, and I think Dr Owens did a good job preparing these projects for the course because I definitely learned a lot from them.

#### Exams

There were two midterms and one final exam. The midterms covered content in the first 1/3 and second 1/3 of the course respectively, and the final was mostly the last 1/3 with a little bit of everything else. The exams were all open-book, open-laptop (no internet). The kind of problems that showed up during the exams were purely conceptual i.e., if you got it, you got it. Taking these exams was a breath of fresh air because I knew for sure the professor wasn't trying to trip me up or anything and genuinely cared about my learning based on the problems that showed up during the exam. Despite being open-book, you wouldn't be able to solve most of the problems purely by just referring to the textbook or lecture notes (that's probably why the averages were so low).

Dr Owens had provided sample exams (a past-year set of papers from 2019) to show the nature of the problems we'd be facing during the actual exam. The sample exams weren't particularly helpful since nothing similar showed up in the actual exam. Preparation for the actual exams just involved fully understanding the concepts and making sure I wasn't confused about anything. Redoing some of the homework problems was helpful as well.

I scored slightly above average for the first midterm, 2 sd above the average for the second midterm and 2 sd above the average for the final.

#### Game Plan & Results

Going into the course, I immediately noticed I had a leg up on everyone else for the first one quarter of the content covered. I already had experience with ARM assembly and transferring those skills into RISC-V wasn't a problem at all. Consequently, the projects were a cakewalk. Preparing for the exams was a bit more tricky because the textbook isn't particularly verbose about some of the concepts it's supposed to be teaching so I had to go look online for some lecture sets from other universities. One really helpful set of lectures available on Youtube is by [Dr Prabhas Chongstitvatana](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCoY6tUQ1u-4nyKmcRTWr8w) from Chualongkorn University. Reviewing that lecture set and going through the homework problems turned out to be sufficient for a good grade.

Expected Grade: A  
Final Grade: A

### EEC 145: Electronic Materials

This course was taught by Professor Charles Hunt. The text was Principles of Electronic Materials and Devices 4 ed. by S.O. Kasap. This was a particularly challenging class for me because I didn't actually meet any of the prerequisites for this class. Once quantum mechanics and semiconductor physics started showing up halfway into the course, I was having a hard time catching up.

Dr Hunt is a funny guy (lol) who says a lot of random stuff during his lectures that have little to do with the course content, but is still interesting (sometimes) nonetheless. I liked the TA for this course- she was kinda cute and she also marked my exams and homework pretty leniently :).

This course, while difficult, taught me a lot of interesting things like electromigration failure, 2-D crystals, electrocoolers, electron scattering, thin films, choosing dielectrics for optimal propagation time, etc. I enjoyed learning everything that was taught in this course.

#### Office Hours & Consultation

There were office hour slots for the professor and the TA at awkward times so I never could attend them. There were also review sessions before the midterms and the finals that I made sure I attended. The review sessions covered the kinds of problems that would show up during the exam and were really helpful, but only half of the class would ever attend them (LMAO). The TA would do the review sessions on Zoom and record them. I think she did all the review sessions while she was stoned or something which was pretty funny.

#### Lectures

Lecture slides were not provided before the start of each lecture. Readings were required before attending the lectures because

1. You wouldn't understand anything he was saying if you didn't do the reading in advance
2. There would be a quiz during the lecture (total of 10 quizzes throughout the quarter) and you'd screw yourself over for that if you decided not to do the reading for whatever reason

There were a couple of times when I didn't bother to do the reading at all and messed up the quizzes (drew flowers for the TA :)). The quizzes sometimes covered key points that would show up during the exams so I probably should have taken them more seriously, but a man can only do so much when he's taking 24 units in one quarter right?

Lecture quality was abysmal (sorry prof). If not for the quizzes, I don't think I would have attended any of the lectures. The reading is verbose yet concise (???) enough to help you understand the content, and any missing prerequisite knowledge could be filled in with a quick Google search.

During the online portion of school, online lectures were boring enough that I would just wait for the quiz to finish and then leave because the lecture was recorded anyway.

#### Assignments & Projects

Homework was posted weekly and was based on the reading for that week. The homework problems were all from the textbook but some of them were strange in that you couldn't really solve them based off information in the textbook alone. Don't really have much to say for the homework besides 'standard' and 'uninspiring'.

#### Exams

The first midterm was online and open-book. Second midterm was closed-book with single page, double-sided cheatsheet. Final exam was the same format as the second midterm.

The exam problems were mostly simple things that checked whether you understood a concept or not. Despite being open-book, the first midterm still needed a good amount of preparation both from attending the review sessions and doing the homework problems. The second midterm and final exam weren't really related to the homework problems all that much but attending the review sessions was still massive for preparation.

I scored the highest in class for the first midterm, got the 2nd highest in class for the second midterm and got 1 sd above the mean for the final.

#### Game Plan & Results

This course was difficult from the start till the end. They started throwing material science stuff at me (which I fortunately had some experience with) at the start and then suddenly we started doing quantum mechanics (I still don't know how Schrodinger's equation works or what a wavefunction is) and I just tried to remember the stuff I understood and discard anything that didn't make sense to me. The last couple of topics were much easier to digest and just 'made sense' to me.

I felt like I struggled for the exams but the TA marked my answers so leniently (I drew a flower for the second midterm and she drew a smiley face next to it), ![Flower with a smiley face next to it on my exam paper](/blog/eec145flower.jpg) and everyone else in the class was just scoring so much worse than me that even I managed to surprise myself with my performance in this class.

Expected Grade: B+  
Final Grade: A

### EEC 150: Intro to Signals and Systems

This course was taught by Professor Khaled Abdel-Ghaffar. The text was Signal Processing and Linear Systems by Lathi and Green, 2 ed.

The format of the class was entirely online for the entire quarter. All lectures were conducted on Zoom and recorded. Midterm and final were both held online with no proctoring.

You were guaranteed a C- if your weighted mark was 50% overall for the course. I was just aiming for that 50% the whole time because I had no hope left for a good grade in this course.

Possibly the worst class I've ever taken in any university. The instructor was bad, the text was bad, the lecture notes were (kinda) bad, the homework was extremely time-consuming and didn't really teach me anything, the exams were all online and open-book and involved regurgitating stuff from the homework and examples in the textbook. I didn't learn anything from this course; it was so bad that I'm currently reviewing the signals and systems course at my own university so I won't die when I take the next class that requires signals and systems as a pre-requisite.

#### Office Hours & Consultation

There were office hour slots for the professor and one of the TAs. I never attended office hours because they were held at awkward times for me. Apparently, the professor is really helpful during office hours based on what I heard in the course Discord server. I can't comment further on this, however.

#### Lectures

Dr Abdel-Ghaffar has a set of lecture notes that are very vague and he just reads them out during lecture in the most monotonous voice that it becomes difficult to pay attention. On top of that, he doesn't seem to explain any of the concepts in detail, he just assumes that you know what something is and why equation X is used to describe it or whatever. The textbook will not lend clarity to any of the things he mentions during lecture, it is indeed one of the worst textbooks ever written.

I stopped attending lectures after the second week and just watched Youtube videos to study for this course.

#### Assignments & Projects

Homework was assigned weekly on Thursdays 12pm and due on the following Thursday at 12pm. 12pm...

12pm!!! Why did he choose such a strange time for homework to be due? I will never know, but there were a few times when he gave extensions because enough people complained. People also started complaining about the length of the homeworks which were like 7 problems long with 3 parts each + stuff that needed Matlab. People were sacrificing so much time doing the homework that it was ruining their midterm prep for other courses (meanwhile, my friend and I were practically dying taking 7 and 6 courses respectively lol).

The homework problems were straightforward but it was all just math to me. I figured that I would be able to make sense of some of the concepts from doing the homework problems but none of it made sense to me at all.

#### Exams

There was a midterm and a final, both online but with very different formats.

The midterm was basically a set of 8 quizzes on Canvas that ran consecutively for 15 minutes each, and you had to upload a pdf of your solutions before the quiz closed. This was kind of messy but I had an iPad so things were pretty smooth sailing for me. A lot of people in the Discord complained about not being able to upload their solutions in time.

The final was the same thing with 8 quizzes but he changed the format to multiple-choice because marking the midterm was so time consuming (go figure). Even though it was multiple-choice, the problems were straightforward with no tricks involved. Once again, people in the Discord lamented about the final and how it was so difficult (I beg to differ).

Yeah, I don't know how I did it but I got 1 sd above the mean for the midterm and 2 sd above the mean for the final. I guess people in this university are really... special... lmao.

#### Game Plan & Results

After submitting the second homework, I realised I couldn't spend so much time doing homework for this course because it was taking so much time away from my other courses. I just started drawing flowers for the next couple of homework sets. I got a 5/24 for the third homework and a little better for my fourth homework but things went on a steady decline as I was preoccupied with midterms (double midterms for EEC 170 and EEC 145). Once I was done with all my midterms, I scored almost full for my last two homework sets.

After the result of the midterm was released, I knew straightaway that I had some sort of natural advantage over most of the other students (I had more than 2 functioning brain cells). So, keeping that in mind I just aimed to get a good score for the final to make sure I had that overall 50% mark in the bag.

Aim for the stars, land on the moon, as they say. I don't feel like I put in enough effort for this course (I was spread thinly across every course anyway) but I still managed to wreck the curve somehow... without understanding 99% of the things taught in the course.

Expected Grade: C-  
Final Grade: A-
